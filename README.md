# scaff

Painless scaffolding of the boring part of setting up projects that
people other than you can use.

Scaff can be used to generate licenses, initial READMEs, makefiles,
build derivations, whatever really. All thanks to the awesome
[Tera](https://tera.netlify.com/) templating engine!

## Example use
